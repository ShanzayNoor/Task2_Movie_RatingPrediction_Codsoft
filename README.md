# Task2_Movie_RatingPrediction_Codsoft
IMDB_dataset for movie  rating prediction, This project aims to build a movie rating prediction model that can accurately predict the ratings users might give to movies they have not yet seen. The model will be developed.

Tools and Technologies:
Python for data preprocessing and model development.
Popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
Data visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
GitHub for version control and hosting the project repository.

Expected Outcomes:
A well-trained movie rating prediction model.
A GitHub repository with clean, well-documented code.
Insights into the movie dataset and user behavior.

Project Benefits:

Offers a practical application of machine learning and data science.
Provides a valuable resource for movie recommendation systems.
